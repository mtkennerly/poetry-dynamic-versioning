# Dynamic versioning plugin for Poetry
This is a Python 3.7+ plugin for [Poetry 1.2.0+](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry)
and [Poetry Core 1.0.0+](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core)
to enable dynamic versioning based on tags in your version control system,
powered by [Dunamai](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai).
Many different version control systems are supported, including Git and Mercurial;
please refer to the Dunamai page for the full list
(and minimum supported version where applicable).

Once the plugin is set up,
you can create tags in your version control system (e.g., `git tag v0.1.0 -m "New release"`),
and the plugin will automatically insert that version into relevant files
(like `pyproject.toml` or `*.py` files with a `__version__`  line)
for the duration of Poetry commands such as `poetry build`,
then revert the changes afterwards to keep your repository clean.
The plugin aims to inject a static copy of the version into build artifacts (sdists/wheels)
without the need to manually edit and commit changed files in your repository.

`poetry-dynamic-versioning` provides a build backend that patches Poetry Core
to enable the versioning system in PEP 517 build frontends.
When installed with the `plugin` feature (i.e., `poetry-dynamic-versioning[plugin]`),
it also integrates with the Poetry CLI to trigger the versioning in commands like `poetry build`.

For Poetry 1.1.x, you can use an older version of `poetry-dynamic-versioning` (0.17.1 or earlier)
that relied on a `*.pth` import hack, but this is no longer supported,
so you should migrate to the standardized plugin and Poetry 1.2.0+.

## Installation
If you've previously installed the deprecated `poetry-dynamic-versioning-plugin` package,
be sure to uninstall it before proceeding.

* Install the plugin using one of the options below:

  * For Poetry 2.0.0+, add this to your pyproject.toml and then run `poetry install`:
    ```toml
    [tool.poetry.requires-plugins]
    poetry-dynamic-versioning = { version = ">=1.0.0,<2.0.0", extras = ["plugin"] }
    ```
  * For older Poetry versions, depending on how you installed Poetry:
    * In most cases: `poetry self add "poetry-dynamic-versioning[plugin]"`
    * If you installed Poetry with Pipx: `pipx inject poetry "poetry-dynamic-versioning[plugin]"`

  See the [Poetry plugin documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/plugins/#using-plugins)
  for more information about these options.
* Run this in your project: `poetry dynamic-versioning enable`

  Or you can update your pyproject.toml manually to include these fields:

  ```toml
  [project]
  dynamic = ["version"]

  [tool.poetry]
  version = "0.0.0"

  [tool.poetry-dynamic-versioning]
  enable = true
  ```

  Include the plugin in the `build-system` section of pyproject.toml
  for interoperability with PEP 517 build frontends:

  ```toml
  [build-system]
  requires = ["poetry-core>=1.0.0", "poetry-dynamic-versioning>=1.0.0,<2.0.0"]
  build-backend = "poetry_dynamic_versioning.backend"
  ```

  This is a thin wrapper around `poetry.core.masonry.api`.

Poetry still requires the `tool.poetry.version` field to be present in pyproject.toml,
but you are encouraged to use `version = "0.0.0"` as a standard placeholder.

With the minimal configuration above,
the plugin will automatically take effect when you run commands such as `poetry build`.
It will update the version in pyproject.toml, then revert the change when the plugin deactivates.

The default configuration will also update any pre-existing
`__version__ = "0.0.0"` and `__version_tuple__ = (0, 0, 0)` placeholders in some files.
You can configure additional substitution patterns/files as needed (see below).

## Configuration
In your pyproject.toml file, you may configure the following options:

* `[tool.poetry-dynamic-versioning]`:
  General options.
  * `enable` (boolean, default: false):
    Since the plugin has to be installed globally,
    this setting is an opt-in per project.
  * `vcs` (string, default: `any`):
    This is the version control system to check for a version.
    One of: `any`, `git`, `mercurial`, `darcs`, `bazaar`, `subversion`, `fossil`, `pijul`.
  * `metadata` (boolean, default: unset):
    If true, include the commit hash in the version,
    and also include a dirty flag if `dirty` is true.
    If unset, metadata will only be included if you are on a commit without a version tag.
    This is ignored when `format` or `format-jinja` is used.
  * `tagged-metadata` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, include any tagged metadata discovered as the first part of the metadata segment.
    Has no effect when `metadata` is set to false.
    This is ignored when `format` or `format-jinja` is used.
  * `dirty` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, include a dirty flag in the metadata,
    indicating whether there are any uncommitted changes.
    Has no effect when `metadata` is set to false.
    This is ignored when `format` or `format-jinja` is used.
  * `pattern` (string):
    This is a regular expression which will be used to find a tag representing a version.
    When this is unset, Dunamai's default pattern is used.

    There must be a capture group named `base` with the main part of the version.
    Optionally, it may contain another two groups named `stage` and `revision` for prereleases,
    and it may contain a group named `tagged_metadata` to be used with the `tagged-metadata` option.
    There may also be a group named `epoch` for the PEP 440 concept.

    If the `base` group is not included,
    then this will be interpreted as a named preset from the Dunamai `Pattern` class.
    This includes: `default`, `default-unprefixed` (makes the `v` prefix optional).

    You can check the default for your installed version of Dunamai by running this command:
    ```
    poetry run python -c "import dunamai; print(dunamai.Pattern.Default.regex())"
    ```

    Remember that backslashes must be escaped in the TOML file.

    ```toml
    # Regular expression:
    pattern = '(?P<base>\d+\.\d+\.\d+)'
    # Named preset:
    pattern = "default-unprefixed"
    ```
  * `pattern-prefix` (string):
    This will be inserted after the pattern's start anchor (`^`).
    For example, to match tags like `some-package-v1.2.3`,
    you can keep the default pattern and set the prefix to `some-package-`.
  * `format` (string, default: unset):
    This defines a custom output format for the version. Available substitutions:

    * `{base}`
    * `{stage}`
    * `{revision}`
    * `{distance}`
    * `{commit}`
    * `{dirty}`
    * `{tagged_metadata}`
    * `{branch}`
    * `{branch_escaped}` which omits any non-letter/number characters
    * `{timestamp}` of the current commit, which expands to YYYYmmddHHMMSS as UTC

    Example: `v{base}+{distance}.{commit}`
  * `format-jinja` (string, default: unset):
    This defines a custom output format for the version,
    using a [Jinja](https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2) template.
    When this is set, `format` is ignored.

    Available variables:

    * `base` (string)
    * `stage` (string or None)
    * `revision` (integer or None)
    * `distance` (integer)
    * `commit` (string)
    * `dirty` (boolean)
    * `tagged_metadata` (string or None)
    * `version` (dunumai.Version)
    * `env` (dictionary of environment variables)
    * `branch` (string or None)
    * `branch_escaped` (string or None)
    * `timestamp` (string or None)

    Available functions:

    * `bump_version` ([from Dunamai](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai/blob/fe69436133d0ea2097a9fed1dbb31ec96263cf83/dunamai/__init__.py#L1965-L1977))
    * `serialize_pep440` ([from Dunamai](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai/blob/fe69436133d0ea2097a9fed1dbb31ec96263cf83/dunamai/__init__.py#L1863-L1886))
    * `serialize_semver` ([from Dunamai](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai/blob/fe69436133d0ea2097a9fed1dbb31ec96263cf83/dunamai/__init__.py#L1917-L1931))
    * `serialize_pvp` ([from Dunamai](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai/blob/fe69436133d0ea2097a9fed1dbb31ec96263cf83/dunamai/__init__.py#L1945-L1954))

    Simple example:

    ```toml
    format-jinja = "{% if distance == 0 %}{{ base }}{% else %}{{ base }}+{{ distance }}.{{ commit }}{% endif %}"
    ```

    Complex example:

    ```toml
    format-jinja = """
        {%- if distance == 0 -%}
            {{ serialize_pep440(base, stage, revision) }}
        {%- elif revision is not none -%}
            {{ serialize_pep440(base, stage, revision + 1, dev=distance, metadata=[commit]) }}
        {%- else -%}
            {{ serialize_pep440(bump_version(base), stage, revision, dev=distance, metadata=[commit]) }}
        {%- endif -%}
    """
    ```
  * `format-jinja-imports` (array of tables, default: empty):
    This defines additional things to import and make available to the `format-jinja` template.
    Each table must contain a `module` key and may also contain an `item` key. Consider this example:

    ```toml
    format-jinja-imports = [
        { module = "foo" },
        { module = "bar", item = "baz" },
    ]
    ```

    This is roughly equivalent to:

    ```python
    import foo
    from bar import baz
    ```

    `foo` and `baz` would then become available in the Jinja formatting.
  * `style` (string, default: unset):
    One of: `pep440`, `semver`, `pvp`.
    These are preconfigured output formats.
    If you set both a `style` and a `format`,
    then the format will be validated against the style's rules.
    If `style` is unset, the default output format will follow PEP 440,
    but a custom `format` will only be validated if `style` is set explicitly.
  * `latest-tag` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, then only check the latest tag for a version,
    rather than looking through all the tags until a suitable one is found to match the `pattern`.
  * `bump` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, then increment the last part of the version `base` by 1,
    unless the `stage` is set,
    in which case increment the `revision` by 1 or set it to a default of 2 if there was no `revision`.
    Does nothing when on a commit with a version tag.

    Example, if there have been 3 commits since the `v1.3.1` tag:
    * PEP 440 with `bump = false`: `1.3.1.post3.dev0+28c1684`
    * PEP 440 with `bump = true`: `1.3.2.dev3+28c1684`
  * `tag-dir` (string, default: `tags`):
    This is the location of tags relative to the root.
    This is only used for Subversion.
  * `tag-branch` (string, default: unset):
    Branch on which to find tags, if different than the current branch.
    This is only used for Git currently.
  * `full-commit` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, get the full commit hash instead of the short form.
    This is only used for Git and Mercurial.
  * `strict` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, then fail instead of falling back to 0.0.0 when there are no tags.
  * `fix-shallow-repository` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, then automatically try to fix shallow repositories.
    Currently, this only supports Git and will run `git fetch --unshallow`.
  * `ignore-untracked` (boolean, default: false):
    If true, ignore untracked files when determining whether the repository is dirty.
* `[tool.poetry-dynamic-versioning.substitution]`:
  Insert the dynamic version into additional files other than just pyproject.toml.
  These changes will be reverted when the plugin deactivates.
  * `files` (array of strings): Globs for any files that need substitutions. Default:
    `["*.py", "*/__init__.py", "*/__version__.py", "*/_version.py"]`.
    To disable substitution, set this to an empty list.
  * `patterns` (array of strings/tables):
    Regular expressions for the text to replace.
    Each regular expression must have two capture groups,
    which are any text to preserve before and after the replaced text.

    String items are interpreted as a regular expression directly.
    Table items support these keys:
    * `value` (string):
      This is the regular expression.
    * `mode` (string, optional):
      This controls how the version should be inserted. Options:
      * `str` (default):
        Serialize version as-is.
        The capture groups should already include the surrounding quotation marks.
      * `tuple`:
        Serialize `0.1.2.dev0+a.b` as `0, 1, 2, "dev0", "a.b"`.
        The capture groups should already include the surrounding parentheses.

    Default:

    ```toml
    patterns = [
        '''(^__version__\s*(?::.*?)?=\s*['"])[^'"]*(['"])''',
        { value = '''(^__version_tuple__\s*(?::.*?)?=\s*\()[^)]*(\))''', mode = "tuple" },
    ]
    ```

    Remember that the backslashes must be escaped in the TOML file.
  * `folders` (array of tables, default: empty):
    List of additional folders to check for substitutions.

    Each table supports these options:

    * `path` (string, required):
      Path to the folder.
    * `files` (array of strings, optional):
      Override `substitution.files` for this folder.
    * `patterns` (array of strings, optional):
      Override `substitution.patterns` for this folder.

    If you use an `src` layout,
    you may want to keep the default `files`/`patterns` and just specify the following:

    ```toml
    folders = [
      { path = "src" }
    ]
    ```

    This will check the default file globs (e.g., `./*.py`)
    as well as the same file globs inside of `src` (e.g., `./src/*.py`).
* `[tool.poetry-dynamic-versioning.files]` (table, default: empty):
  This section lets you tweak the behavior for individual files.
  Each table key is a path to a specific file (no globs) relative to the project root.
  Each nested table supports these fields:

  If you use these options to generate a file that's ignored by your VCS,
  but you also want the generated file to be included in the output of `poetry build`,
  then you'll need to name the file explicitly in your `tool.poetry.include` config.

  * `persistent-substitution` (boolean, optional):
    If true, then do not revert any substitutions applied to this file.
    This is primarily useful for editable installs, if you need the version to remain in a file ignored by your VCS.
  * `initial-content` (string, optional):
    Set the file content before the substitution phase.
    The file will be created or overwritten as necessary.
    Common leading whitespace will be stripped from each line.
  * `initial-content-jinja` (string, optional):
    Same as `initial-content`, but using Jinja formatting.
    If both options are set, this one takes priority.
    You can use the same imports from `format-jinja-imports` and the same variables from `format-jinja`,
    with this additional variable:

    * `formatted_version` (string) - version formatted by either the `format` or `format-jinja` option

  Example:

  ```toml
  [tool.poetry-dynamic-versioning.files."package/_version.py"]
  persistent-substitution = true
  initial-content = """
    # These version placeholders will be replaced later during substitution.
    __version__ = "0.0.0"
    __version_tuple__ = (0, 0, 0)
  """
  ```
* `[tool.poetry-dynamic-versioning.from-file]`:
  This section lets you read the version from a file instead of the VCS.

  * `source` (string):
    If set, read the version from this file.
    It must be a path relative to the location of pyproject.toml.
    By default, the plugin will read the entire content of the file,
    without leading and trailing whitespace.
  * `pattern` (string):
    If set, use this regular expression to extract the version from the file.
    The first capture group must contain the version.

Simple example:

```toml
[tool.poetry-dynamic-versioning]
enable = true
vcs = "git"
style = "semver"
```

## Environment variables
In addition to the project-specific configuration above,
you can apply some global overrides via environment variables.

* `POETRY_DYNAMIC_VERSIONING_BYPASS`:
  Use this to bypass the VCS mechanisms and use a static version instead.
  The value of the environment variable will be used as the version
  for the active project and any path/SSH dependencies that also use the plugin.
  This is mainly for distro package maintainers who need to patch existing releases,
  without needing access to the original repository.
* `POETRY_DYNAMIC_VERSIONING_OVERRIDE`:
  Use a static version for specific packages only, but leave dynamic versioning enabled otherwise.
  For example, `pkg1 = 0.1.0, pkg2 = 0.2.0` (spaces are optional) would set pkg1 to 0.1.0 and pkg2 to 0.2.0.
  This only affects packages for which poetry-dynamic-versioning is enabled.
  When both variables are set, `OVERRIDE` takes precedence over `BYPASS`.
* `POETRY_DYNAMIC_VERSIONING_COMMANDS`:
  You can set a comma-separated list of Poetry commands during which to activate the versioning.
  For example, `build,publish` will limit the dynamic versioning to those two commands.
  Similarly, setting `POETRY_DYNAMIC_VERSIONING_COMMANDS=""` will disable the dynamic versioning altogether,
  which is useful in isolated environments like Docker where versions may not be computable and not needed anymore.
* `POETRY_DYNAMIC_VERSIONING_COMMANDS_NO_IO`:
  Comma-separated list of Poetry commands during which the plugin should **not** directly modify files.
  The plugin will still set the dynamic version in memory so that Poetry itself can write it as needed.
  Default: `version`.
* `POETRY_DYNAMIC_VERSIONING_DEBUG`:
  If this is set to `1`, then some debug logs will be printed to stderr.
  Right now, this logs some cases where substitution doesn't find anything to change.

## Command line mode
The plugin also has a command line mode for execution on demand.
This mode applies the dynamic version to all relevant files and leaves the changes in-place,
allowing you to inspect the result.
Your configuration will be detected from pyproject.toml as normal,
but the `enable` option is not necessary.

To activate this mode,
either use `poetry dynamic-versioning` (provided by the `plugin` feature)
or `poetry-dynamic-versioning` (standalone script with default features).

## VCS archives
Sometimes, you may only have access to an archive of a repository (e.g., a zip file) without the full history.
The plugin can still detect a version in some of these cases.
Refer to [the Dunamai documentation](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai#vcs-archives) for more info.

## Caveats
All of [Dunamai's caveats](https://github.com/mtkennerly/dunamai#other-notes) apply.
In addition to those:

* The dynamic version is not available during `poetry run` or `poetry shell`
  because of a [Poetry design choice](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/8092)
  that prevents the plugin from cleaning up after itself.
* Regarding PEP 517 support:

  `pip wheel .` and `pip install .` will work with new enough Pip versions
  that default to in-tree builds or support the `--use-feature=in-tree-build` option.
  Older versions of Pip will not work because they create an isolated copy of the source code
  that does not contain the version control history.

  If you want to build wheels of your dependencies, you can do the following,
  although local path-based dependencies may not work:

  ```
  poetry export -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt --without-hashes
  pip wheel -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Regarding PEP 621 support:

  The plugin supports the PEP 621 mode of Poetry 2.0.0+ (`[project]`)
  as well as the classic mode of older Poetry versions (`[tool.poetry]`).
  Which mode the plugin uses depends on how your pyproject.toml is configured:

  * For the plugin to use the classic mode, your pyproject.toml must:
    * specify `tool.poetry.name`
  * For the plugin to use the PEP 621 mode, your pyproject.toml must:
    * not specify `tool.poetry.name`
    * specify `tool.poetry.version` (a placeholder like `"0.0.0"` is fine)
    * specify `project.name`
    * specify `project.dynamic` to contain `"version"`
    * not specify `project.version`

  Note that, in PEP 621 mode,
  the plugin must temporarily remove and then re-add the `tool.poetry.version` key.
  This can result in the key shifting to the bottom of its table.
  Please put the key at the bottom preemptively to avoid any conflicts.
